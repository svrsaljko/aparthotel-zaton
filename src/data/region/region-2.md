briefDescription: The greatest value of this region emerges from the fact that it is a coastal and insular region, and that nature in this part of the Adriatic was especially generous. The climatic characteristics are very favorable. The typical Mediterranean climate is dominated by mild winters and hot summers with minimal precipitation.
